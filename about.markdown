I am finishing my thesis in France and this is where you will find my interests, the results of my independent work (done outside my thesis) and my thoughts.

I plan to write about a few things:

- [My independent project: Toy models to find equitable redistricting solutions using QGIS]()
- [My thoughts Democratic conferdalist approach to governance, borders and geopolitical conflict resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_confederalism)
- [Basic info about my work and my thesis]()
